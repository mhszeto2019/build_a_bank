# build_a_bank

 Thought process:
-  I believe that this program will be used to integrate with other aspects of the company. As such, I designed it in a way such that they are reusable APIs
- Double entry feature


Testing process:
1) Create account
2) Get accounts details
Ledger - withdrawal and deposit will be done in the ledger
3) Test Deposit
4) Test withdrawal - try withdraw a sufficient amount and then withdraw an insufficient amount 
5) try get balance of account
Transfer - transfers will be considered as a transaction
6) Test Transfer
7) try get balance of account
